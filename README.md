# ExploringOrientation
This repo is a place where I will explore and learn about rigid body dynamics and control, focused on bodies which evolve in SO(3) or SE(3).

## Kinematics
This folder contains note and experiments in regarding the kinematics of orientation.

## Dynamics
This folder contains notes and experiments regarding the dynamics or orientation.

## Control
This folder contains notes and experiments regarding the control of orientation.
The system under consideration is a rigid body with three orthogonal flywheels for actuation.
